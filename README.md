play your games without being outed for not doing your job

This is a project I did for GDES30008 Interactive Media during my fifth semester at University of Melbourne. It is inspired by a previous Norwegian Priminister who was caught playing pokemon go during a hearing at parliament.

Games for Politicians is here to help people in the workplace play classic arcade games without being caught for not doing their job. Lean forewards for going down; lean back to go up; scratch your ear, nose or head to go left or right.
